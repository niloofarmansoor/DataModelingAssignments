# wine_visualization

Used this D3 implementation to build my implementation: http://bl.ocks.org/ericcoopey/6382449

wine.data.visualization.html displays the wineries that occur in both the exccellent and poor categories in large, red letters amist all the other wineries from the combined list of excellent and poor wineries. (does not fully fit on the screen)

wine.data.visualization.1.html displays the wineries that are excellent in a word cloud.

wine.data.visualization.2.html displays the wineries that are poor in a word cloud. (does not fully fit on the screen)
